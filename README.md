**Machine Learning Pipeline with Streamlit**

* This project is a modular machine learning pipeline built using Python and Streamlit. It enables users to preprocess data, explore datasets, train machine learning models, and make predictions on unseen data through an intuitive web interface. The pipeline supports a complete machine learning workflow, from data cleaning to model evaluation and prediction.

**Features**
* Preprocessing: Handle missing values and outliers with user-defined options.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze target correlation and generate pairplots for insights.
* Model Training: Train and tune multiple models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVC) using GridSearchCV.
* Model Selection and Evaluation: Automatically pick the best model and evaluate its performance.
* Prediction: Predict outcomes for unseen data with a trained model.
* Visualization: View feature contributions using SHAP.

**Files and Structure**
preprocess.py: Functions for data preprocessing (missing values, outliers).
explore.py: Functions for exploratory data analysis.
train.py: Functions for training and tuning machine learning models.
model.py: Functions for selecting the best model and evaluating feature importance.
prediction.py: Functions for preprocessing and predicting outcomes on unseen data.
classification_app.py: The main Streamlit app that integrates all modules.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies for the project.

**How to Run**
